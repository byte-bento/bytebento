  <p>Not all tech news is created equal. We built ByteBento to cut through the noise — but if you're still craving a few extra helpings of insight, these sources are worth bookmarking.</p>

  <h2>1. <a href="https://techmeme.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techmeme</a></h2>

  <h2>3. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a></h2>
