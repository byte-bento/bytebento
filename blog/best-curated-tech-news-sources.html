  <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">5 Curated Tech News Sources (Besides Us) That Are Actually Worth Your Time</h1>
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Posted June 27, 2025</p>

  <p>Not all tech news is created equal. We built ByteBento to cut through the noise — but if you're still craving a few extra helpings of insight, these sources are worth bookmarking.</p>

  <h2>1. <a href="https://techmeme.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Techmeme</a></h2>
  <p>The OG of tech news aggregation. If something big is breaking in tech, odds are it's already on Techmeme. It's fast, smart, and algorithmically curated — with some human editing thrown in for clarity.</p>
  <p><strong>🧠 Type:</strong> Aggregator<br>
  <strong>📰 What it does well:</strong> Pulls top headlines from trusted tech sources in real time.<br>
  <strong>👍 Why it's useful:</strong> It's fast and reliable.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Heads-up:</strong> Still a firehose. Best in small doses.</p>

  <h2>2. <a href="https://www.tldrnewsletter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TLDR Newsletter</a></h2>
  <p>A daily email that summarizes top stories in tech, science, and startups — in under five minutes. Skimmable, surprisingly broad, and weirdly addictive.</p>
  <p><strong>🧠 Type:</strong> Daily email<br>
  <strong>📬 What it does well:</strong> Summarizes top stories clearly and quickly.<br>
  <strong>👍 Why it's useful:</strong> Incredibly skimmable.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Heads-up:</strong> No website archive. Email-only.</p>

  <h2>3. <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a></h2>
  <p>The best place to discover new apps, gadgets, and tools — often before they go mainstream. Think of it as Reddit for tech launches.</p>
  <p><strong>🧠 Type:</strong> Discovery feed<br>
  <strong>📊 What it does well:</strong> Surfaces new tools and startups every day.<br>
  <strong>👍 Why it's useful:</strong> Great for staying ahead of trends.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Heads-up:</strong> Can feel buzzy or sales-y depending on what's trending.</p>

  <h2>4. <a href="https://stratechery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stratechery</a></h2>
  <p>Sharp, thoughtful commentary on the why behind tech business moves. Written by Ben Thompson, it's basically tech's version of The Economist.</p>
  <p><strong>🧠 Type:</strong> Weekly analysis<br>
  <strong>💬 What it does well:</strong> Explains strategy, business models, and market shifts.<br>
  <strong>👍 Why it's useful:</strong> Makes you smarter about tech business.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Heads-up:</strong> Most posts are behind a paywall.</p>

  <h2>5. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hacker News</a></h2>
  <p>Where engineers, founders, and developers gather to post, debate, and dissect everything from AI to obscure Linux tools.</p>
  <p><strong>🧠 Type:</strong> Community-curated<br>
  <strong>🎙 What it does well:</strong> Surfaces deep, dev-focused stories and comments.<br>
  <strong>👍 Why it's useful:</strong> Great for learning what the tech crowd is actually thinking.<br>
  <strong>⚠️ Heads-up:</strong> Very minimal UI. Not for casual browsing.</p>

  <h2>🔖 Bonus: ByteBento (That's Us)</h2>
  <p>Of course, we wouldn't be building this if we didn't think it was a better way to read tech news.</p>
  <p><strong>🍱 What we do differently:</strong> Byte-sized tech news in a clean, filterable format — without the noise.</p>
  <p><strong>🍱 What we don't do:</strong> Overwhelm you. We keep it curated.</p>
